[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

### Code:
```python3
    d_totalwgt = CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
    d_totalwgt 
```
### Output:
```
    -0.088672927072602
```
In conclusion, the difference in means of first baby's total weights and other baby's total weights is -0.088 standard deviations. That being said, first babies are lighter than others. The difference of total weight is more significant than that of pregnancy length.
